# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model-
Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem in subscription-based industries such as telecom, SaaS, and banking.  
This project builds an **end-to-end Machine Learning solution** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling organizations to take proactive customer retention actions.

The project covers **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and business insights generation**.

 Problem Statement
Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
The objective of this project is to:
- Predict customer churn using historical customer data
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Provide actionable strategies to improve customer retention

 Dataset
- Synthetic telecom customer dataset containing **5,000+ records**
- Data includes:
  - Customer demographics
  - Service usage details
  - Contract type and tenure
  - Billing information
- Target variable: **Churn (Yes / No)**

> Synthetic data is used to ensure privacy while maintaining real-world data patterns.

 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical features
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature scaling
6. Model training and comparison
7. Model evaluation
8. Business insight generation

 Model Performance
- Achieved **~85% accuracy**
- Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression
- Feature importance analysis used to identify churn drivers

 Key Insights & Retention Strategies
1. Customers with **shorter tenure** have a higher churn probability  
   → Improve onboarding and early engagement.
2. Customers with **higher monthly charges** tend to churn more  
   → Introduce flexible pricing and targeted discounts.
3. Customers on **long-term contracts** show lower churn  
   → Promote annual or multi-year subscription plans.

 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Churn distribution visualization
- Correlation heatmap
- Tenure vs churn analysis
- Feature importance using Random Forest
